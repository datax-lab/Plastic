## ðŸ§¬ Overview

**Plastic** is a deep learning framework for the classification and interpretation of plastic-hydrolyzing enzymes (PHEs). It combines a curated dataset of enzymatic sequences with a neural model that not only predicts degradative capabilities but also highlights biologically relevant sequence features through saliency-based explainability.

This work supports efforts in sustainable biotechnology by enabling the identification and mechanistic analysis of novel enzymes involved in plastic degradation.

## ðŸ§  Key Contributions

- **Curated Dataset**: A high-quality benchmark set including validated plastic-degrading enzymes and evolutionarily similar non-degraders.
- **Deep Classifier**: A neural network trained to distinguish degradative from non-degradative enzymes with high performance.
- **Explainability Module**: Attribution maps identify key amino acid residues contributing to enzymatic function.
- **Biological Validation**: Computational predictions are supported by literature-reported motifs and experimentally verified cases.
